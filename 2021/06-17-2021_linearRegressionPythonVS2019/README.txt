About 
This program uses Linear Regression to predict future values
The user must create a csv file, just like the example, with years and values
The user must then go into the code and change the values in the user input to match the file name
The user can also select a different year list, the default is set to 1900 to 2200 
After the user has entered the data and runs the program a csv file named results will be saved in the same directory

Future updates
GUI 
more user friendly 
better csv export
